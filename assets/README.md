## Creating demo.gif

To create a demo GIF for the README:

1. **Recording Tools:**
   - Windows: Use [ScreenToGif](https://www.screentogif.com/) (free, open-source)
   - Alternative: [LICEcap](https://www.cockos.com/licecap/) (cross-platform)
   - PowerShell recording: [Terminalizer](https://terminalizer.com/) for terminal sessions

2. **What to Record:**
   - Launch console.ps1
   - Navigate through main menu with arrow keys
   - Show AWS account selection
   - Demonstrate package manager search/update
   - Show instance management features
   - Keep recording under 30 seconds for optimal file size

3. **Recording Settings:**
   - Frame rate: 15-20 FPS (sufficient for UI demos)
   - Resolution: 800-1000px width (readable on GitHub)
   - Duration: 20-30 seconds (keeps file size manageable)
   - File size target: Under 5MB for GitHub

4. **Save the file:**
   - Save as `demo.gif` in this directory
   - GitHub automatically displays it in the README

## Tips for Great Demo GIFs

- Use a clean terminal window (no clutter)
- Increase terminal font size for readability
- Move cursor/selections deliberately (not too fast)
- Show 2-3 key features in sequence
- Add brief pauses between actions
- Optimize GIF size with tools like [gifsicle](https://www.lcdf.org/gifsicle/)
